# Subby: Simple Subtitle Editor

Small, WIP Python library for parsing and editing subtitles files

You'll need to supply your own srt files to test

## Installation

You can clone this repository or download the code as a zip file. Requires Python, I used version
3.10.4. You can call the API from within a python script (still need to write the documentation...)
Alternatively, you can use this utility from the command line.

More instructions to follow.
